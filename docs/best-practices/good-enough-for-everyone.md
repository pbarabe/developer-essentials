# Principle: Good Enough For Everyone

Your work should be of the quality, completeness, currency, and usability/understandability that you would use if releasing it to the whole world. It should demonstrate your best use of your tools.

When UX-Dev chooses to make something, we deserve to achieve a robust, high quality outcome that we could share with other developers or with the world. Our work should be excellent, but we realize that it can't ever be perfect - this Best Principle should not be a roadblock; instead, it should help us consistently make better stuff.

## Specific questions

If you shared this with the world tomorrow:

* Would you be apologetic or proud?
* Is it general enough to be useful to anyone else?
* Would you feel OK if you had to use it every day?
* Think of an expert in your area. Would they find this to be good work that follows coding standards and best practices?
* If you had to maintain this, would the process be straightforward and expected for this type of thing?
* Would others using your platform benefit from the thing you're making?
  - Others using Drupal would use this module to provide a search box for our catalog.
  - Others using SerialsSolutions 360link would use this stylesheet to override the default styles and draw more attention to the resource link.
  - This might also apply to Millennium environments.

## Rationale

* Making your work good enough for everyone is like a pre-review.
* Assuming that your work will be looked at, critiqued, and questioned should make you think more critically as you do your work.
* Thinking about how others might use your work outside the context of your project should make you reconsider the structure to make it simpler, more reusable and more modular.
* Even though making your work good enough for everyone can take more time in the beginning, it saves time in the long run. Issues can get caught and addressed before the review process, and fixing future problems will be easier and faster.
* Bottom line: following the good enough for everyone principle should increase the quality of your work.

## Exceptions

There may be situational circumstances where this principle doesn't apply or applies in a unique way. Reviewers should document this appropriately.
