## About

This project is meant to help both new team members and those new to Linux to understand how the Web Team uses [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/).

## Why Linux?

There are probably almost as many reasons to use Linux as there are people who use it.
The Grad College web team uses Linux in part because of the tried-and-true shared history of Linux, Unix, and web site development and web hosting.
We also prefer, as much as possible, to use Open Source tools that do not impact our limited budget & resources.

### OK, so why Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is both very full-featured and pretty easy for new users to learn compared to some other Linux distributions.
It's also the _server_ distribution we typically use for our web and database servers, in large part because of the Long-term Service (LTS) release versions maintained by Canonical (Ubuntu's parent organization).
LTS releases are officially maintained for 5 years, which allows us be confident that the applications we build & host can be maintained and updated for a fairly long period of time.
It also means that our desktop and server environments can be similar, which helps us as developers by enabling us to work with tool sets that are common to both platforms.

## Introducing the Command-Line

If you're not already familiar with Linux, you'll come to understand very quickly that the command-line is one of our most used and most important tools.
Learning how to use it well may seem daunting at first, but

A quick Google search for [Linux command-line tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+command-line+tutorial) reveals no shortage of things to read and watch.
Below are just a few that are _mostly_ relevant to Ubuntu.

- [Using The Terminal - Ubuntu Community Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)
- [TutorialsPoint - Ubuntu Command Line](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ubuntu/ubuntu_command_line.htm)
- [Ryan's Linux Tutoria](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)
- [Unix for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)

Spend a little with these tools to get familiar with the launching the Terminal and learning to use the following concepts and commands:

- Files and directories
- `pwd` - _Present Working Directory_, ie. find out what directory you're "in"
- `ls` - List files (in the current directory)
- `file filename` - See what kind of file _filename_ is
- `mkdir dirname` - Make a directory called _dirname_
- `cd dirname` - _Change Directory_, ie. switch to a different directory
- `touch filename` - Create an empty file called _filename_ (if it doesn't exist). Or change the timestamp of an existing file called _filename_
